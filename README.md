# Chatting-with-multiple-pdf-using-llama-2-70B-
This repository contains the code for a Multi-Docs ChatBot built using Streamlit, Hugging Face models, and the llama-2-70b language model. The chatbot processes uploaded documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT), extracts text, and allows users to interact with a conversational chain powered by the llama-2-70b model.
